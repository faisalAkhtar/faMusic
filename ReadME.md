A web based music player, which is a  browser-native single page application (SPA), that uses the browser's native APIs to manage songs' playing environment. It can be very easily integrated to a backend service for authentication and fetching songs (something to do in the future). As of now, it takes a hardcoded login/pass and plays songs from a json in a file (static).
